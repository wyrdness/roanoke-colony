      "summary": "The Lost Colony of Roanoke was an English settlement established in 1587 on Roanoke Island in present-day North Carolina. When Governor John White returned from England in 1590, all 115+ colonists had vanished, leaving only the word 'CROATOAN' carved on a post.",
      "full": "The Roanoke Colony represents one of America's oldest unsolved historical mysteries. Established in 1587 under Governor John White, the colony consisted of 115-117 colonists including men, women, and children - among them White's daughter Eleanor and granddaughter Virginia Dare, the first English child born in the Americas. White returned to England for supplies but was delayed three years by the Anglo-Spanish War. Upon his return in 1590, he found the settlement deserted with no signs of struggle, only the word 'CROATOAN' carved on a fort post and 'CRO' on a tree. While genuinely mysterious at the time, modern archaeological evidence, DNA studies, and historical research strongly suggest the colonists integrated with local Native American tribes, particularly the Croatoan (Hatteras) Indians, rather than meeting a mysterious fate. This case demonstrates how historical mysteries can have probable mundane explanations discovered through scientific investigation."
