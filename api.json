In 1587, 115-117 English colonists established a settlement on Roanoke Island in what is now North Carolina. When Governor John White returned from England in 1590 after a three-year delay, he found the settlement completely abandoned with no signs of struggle—only the word **\\\"CROATOAN\\\"** carved into a wooden post."
